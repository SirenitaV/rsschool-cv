### About me
For a couple of years, I felt myself at the wrong place doing something I do not really like. I believe I can do much more than I do now. After long researches and analysis, I realized that I wish to develop applications. Perhaps, web-based. So, my goal is to get the necessary skills to start as soon as possible.

* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* JavaScript - basics 
* C# - basics
* Trello 
* GitHub
* Figma and Perfect Pixel for web-development
* Node Js

A little experience in creating web pages, simple applications during RS Preschool program (stage 0) and stage 1.

In the meantime, I am finalizing CS50 at Harvard College and ready to work hard on Javascript/Frontend in RS School.

### Coding Example:

  let b = Math.floor(num/2);
  let a = b + 1;
  return (a*a) + '-' + (b*b);
};
```
